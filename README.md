# Discord Jira Bot
It's a base for a Discord bot with connection to Jira, you can mdoficate and add another commands, another queries. Enjoy ;)

You can fork that or clone to your computer and use the code to make your own bot.

There's a ***.env*** example where you can see how to put your credentials from **Discord** and **Jira**, inside a .env file.

Use `npm run dev` to start the bot in dev mode. We are using nodemon to run in dev mode.

Use `npm start` to start the bot in production mode.
